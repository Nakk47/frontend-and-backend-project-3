                    <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned were current, if now more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>
                    <p>" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro coures and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. sice completing the course, I've successsfully switch careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                    <h1>Awsome teaching support form TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experience was easy.</h1>
                    <p>" The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidance necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need form an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>

            <h1 class="white">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
            <p>" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programing step by step. I was encourageed to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my develoment experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
